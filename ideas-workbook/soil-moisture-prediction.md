## Soil Moisture Prediction Using AI

### 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Develop a predictive model to forecast soil moisture levels at various depths and locations using historical sensor data.
- **Importance**: Accurate soil moisture predictions help optimize irrigation schedules, reduce water usage, and improve crop yields.

### 2. Data Collection and Preparation
- **Data Sources**:
  - **CAF_sensors Folder**:
    - **Daily and Hourly Subfolders**: Contains volumetric water content (VW) and temperature readings.
  - **CAF_BulkDensity.txt**: Provides bulk density values at different sensor depths.
  - **CAF_ParticleSize.txt**: Contains particle size fractions (sand, silt, clay) for each location at sensor depths.

- **Data Extraction**:
  - Extract VW and temperature readings from the 42 `.txt` files in the `CAF_sensors` folder.
  - Extract bulk density and particle size data from their respective files.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
  - **Outlier Detection**: Detect and manage outliers in the data.
  - **Normalization**: Normalize or standardize features to ensure consistent scaling.
  - **Temporal Aggregation**: Aggregate hourly data to daily averages if necessary.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Time-Based Features**:
  - Day of the year
  - Hour of the day (for hourly predictions)

- **Soil Properties**:
  - Bulk density values
  - Particle size fractions (sand, silt, clay)

- **Derived Features**:
  - Soil texture classifications based on particle size fractions
  - Historical moving averages of soil moisture and temperature

### 4. Model Development
- **Model Selection**:
  - **Time-Series Models**: Use models suitable for time-series prediction, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or ARIMA models.

- **Training and Validation**:
  - **Training Data**: Use historical soil moisture and temperature data to train the model.
  - **Validation Data**: Split data into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Optimize model hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Use metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
