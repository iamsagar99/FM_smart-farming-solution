# Precision Farming System Proposal Using AI

The agricultural sector faces significant challenges, including water scarcity, soil degradation, and the need for increased crop productivity. Precision farming leverages advanced technologies to optimize resource use and improve crop yields. By using the AI and the dataset collected from Bronson, which include detailed soil moisture, temperature, electrical conductivity, crop data, and more, we can create a comprehensive precision farming system.
